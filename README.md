# sf-train-inference-pipeline

This repo contains the code to build the pipeline described in this Medium article: link

It is assumed that you have some exposure to Snowflake and that your environment is set up to work with Snowpark for Python. If you need help, look here! https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/setup

The code helps to create this pipeline, excluding the data coming in from Snowpipe Streaming.
